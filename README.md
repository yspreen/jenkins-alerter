# Jenkins Alerter @[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jenkins-alerter/odllfdbmlegdfhcaaaigenjolldijgpm)

Jenkins is an automated build server. You can configure it to have steps in the pipeline where the user has to click a button to continue the build. Since these buttons have a timeout, the build process will cancel if you don't react on time. This is a pretty annoying mistake to make, so you really don't want to miss the button click. This extension beeps at you whenever you need to click the button!
